# viaja-facil::create stops

This tool helps converting paths stored in GPX format into a CSV format that can be used to upload bus and train lines to viaja facil.

The data for the bus lines comes from the CNRT.

Basically the steps to add a route are:
1.) Draw the route with a tool like http://www.routeconverter.com/ in GPX format
2.) Use the converter to convert the data into CSV
3.) Use the upload tool to upload the data to GAE
