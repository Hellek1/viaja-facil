	<div class="faqitem-content">Select start and destination by entering a direction or point of interest, or by right-clicking on the map. Afterwards click the &quot;search&quot; button to begin the search. The search includes buses, subway and urban railways. You can search within all of the Gran Buenos Aires metropolitan area, from Zárate to La Plata. The search considers transports within a distance of approximately seven blocks around the start and destination points. If you log-in with your Google account you can store your favourite places for easier access.</div></li>

<ul>
	<li><div class="faqitem-header">How does the search work?</div>
	<div class="faqitem-content">As the first step, viaja fácil tries to find connections using just one line, or the subway and train services. If this search
	does not give any results or if you want to see if better results can be found, a search with combinations is run. This search puts a lot of load on the server,
	therefore it is only run as a second step.</div></li>

	<div class="faqitem-content">The number of searches you can run within 10 minutes is limited to keep the app fast for all users.
	Generally you should not need to make so many searches anyway.</div></li>

	For example if you want the street Sarandí in the city Buenos Aires and search gives you the locality Sarandí in Avellaneda, you would enter<br/>
	&quot;Calle Xyz, localidad&quot; (Calle Sarandí 123, CABA)
